ERROR: System recieved a signal named SIGSEGV and the program has to stop immediately!
This signal was generated when a program tries to read or write outside the memory that is allocated for it, or to write memory that can only be read.
Possible cause of this problem may be: 1) the depth setting of pointer type argument is much larger than it needed; 2)insufficient depth of array argument; 3)null pointer etc.
Current execution stopped during CodeState = DELETE_CHAR_BUFFERS.
You can search CodeState variable name in apatb*.cpp file under ./sim/wrapc dir to locate the position.
